# 🌱 Fidan - Plant Trees While You Focus

> **Fidan** (Turkish for "sapling" or "young tree") is an open-source Pomodoro timer that helps you stay focused while growing a virtual forest. Every sponsorship plants real trees through environmental initiatives.

## 🌳 Mission

Fidan combines productivity with environmental impact. While you focus on your work using the Pomodoro technique, you grow virtual trees in the app. Through GitHub Sponsors, we convert virtual forests into real ones by donating 100% of sponsorship proceeds to tree-planting organizations.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Classic 25-minute focus sessions with breaks
- **Virtual Forest**: Grow trees as you complete Pomodoro sessions
- **Cross-Platform**: 
  - Android app (Phase 1)
  - Garmin wearable app (Phase 1)
  - iOS, Web, Desktop via Kotlin Multiplatform (Phase 2)
- **Gamification**: Different tree species, forest themes, and achievements
- **Statistics**: Track your focus time and environmental impact
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent, community-driven development
