# Implementation for Issue #49: DevOps: Build artifact cleanup needed across worktrees

## Issue Description
## Problem
Multiple worktrees contain build artifacts that can cause conflicts and consume unnecessary disk space:

Found build artifacts in:
- `main/issue-39-garmin-sync/android-app/app/build/`
- `issue-16/android-app/app/build/`
- Multiple `.gradle` cache directories across worktrees

## Impact
- Increased disk usage
- Potential conflicts between different branch builds
- Slower checkout/sync operations
- Inconsistent build states

## Current State
```
./main/issue-39-garmin-sync/android-app/app/build/intermediates/
./issue-16/android-app/app/build/intermediates/
./main/android-app/.gradle
./issue-16/android-app/.gradle
```

## Solution
1. **Immediate Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   find . -name "build" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   find . -name ".gradle" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```

2. **Prevention**:
   - Update `.gitignore` to ensure build dirs are ignored
   - Add cleanup script for developers
   - Consider shared Gradle cache configuration

3. **Automation**:
   - Add cleanup step to CI/CD pipeline
   - Pre-commit hook to prevent committing build artifacts

## Recommended .gitignore additions
```
**/build/
**/.gradle/
*.apk
*.aab
```

## Priority
Low-Medium - Housekeeping issue but affects developer experience

## Research Findings
ðŸ’¡ Answer: Best practices for DevOps build artifact cleanup across worktrees include automated scripts to delete old artifacts and regular cleanup schedules. Use CI/CD pipelines to manage and remove outdated artifacts efficiently. Implement version control to track and manage artifact versions.

   We create MRs for everything from trivial one line bug fixes to big features. With bigger MR:s we want merge commits and keep the MR commit history....
